In the plot above, we can see that the no. of recovered people and total positive cases are both increasing.

In the plot above, we can obervse that as the number of positive cases is increasing, initially deaths have increased at a high rate but after a point, the rate of death has become gradually inceasing.

In the above graph, it is clearly visible that the maximum number of deaths occured in Lombardia which is more than 20,000 people.
# Conclusion
- As **Total Positive Cases have increased**, simultaneously **Number of Recovered people** has also increased.
- As **Number of Home Confinment** have increaed, the **Number of deaths** has decreased and **Number of recovered** has increased. Thus, proving that the steps taken by the Italian Govt. to keep people inside their homes have led to lesser deaths
- Most number of deaths have taken place at **Lombardia**
